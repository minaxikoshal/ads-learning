<h1>Create Multiple Columns</h1>

<div class="newspaper">
These are the columns which are generated by the help of column-count property.
The text is distributed over the three columns seperately and in a significant manner.
However the text is filled from left to right following the sequence appropriately.
That's How Multicolumns property works.
